Here are the bugs and features that need to be implemented in current app.

Bugs : 

- email should be stored in lowercase && and while login, email should be checked after converting to lowercase.

- When we search something in homescreen. at that point if we click back button from mobile, it logouts and redirects to Open Page.

- For some of the pokemons, progress chart is showing wrong.
    reason/solution : for progress chart range is 0-1. here we are dividing stats by 100 to get data in required range.
    but some pokemons have data over 100. eg 109 -> 109/100 = 1.09. which is >1 . so convert according(divide stats with max value.)

features:

- when search button is clicked, it will open search box and we can serch pokemons.
    at this time, the search icon should dissaper and a close mark should be there beside search box.
    On clicking close button of search box. it should return to normal look and all 20 pokemons should be shown.

- on reaching the last pokemon, another list of 20 pokemons should be fetched and shown.
    solution : on fetching the first 20 pokemons, you will also get a api link for next 20. use that.

- Sign in with google feature.

- add strict validations for email and password.
